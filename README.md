# PostCrossing Replica â€” MongoDB, API, and Firefox Extension

## Overview

This project is a simplified replica of the original PostCrossing concept, where users send and receive postcards from random people around the world. The idea is that for every postcard a user sends, they will receive one back from another participant.

The project demonstrates backend development, database integration, and browser extension functionality. It includes:

* A **MongoDB database** for storing users and postcard data
* A **Node.js and Express API** for handling postcard exchange and user pairing
* A **Firefox Extension** for sorting PostCrossing tabs

This project was developed for academic purposes to practice full-stack development and API design concepts.

## Core Functionality

### Reciprocal Postcard Exchange

1. When a user requests to send a postcard, the system checks for any waiting users.
2. If a match is found, both users are paired, and postcards are generated for each direction.
3. If no match is found, the user is added to a waiting queue until another user joins.
4. This ensures a balanced and continuous postcard exchange cycle.

## Firefox Extension Features

* **Tab Sorting:** Sort open PostCrossing tabs in ascending or descending order based on postcard codes.
