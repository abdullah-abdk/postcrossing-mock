# 🌍 PostCrossing Replica — MongoDB + API + Firefox Extension

# What is PostCrossing?
PostCrossing is a real-world website where:

Users register and create profiles with their addresses
Users request to "send a card" and receive a random recipient's address
Users physically mail postcards to the recipient
Once the recipient receives and registers the postcard, the sender becomes eligible to receive a postcard from another random user
This creates a continuous cycle of postcard exchange worldwide

# 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive mock implementation of PostCrossing.com, a platform where users can send and receive postcards from random strangers around the world. The core concept is simple yet elegant: for every postcard you send, you receive one back from someone else.

# It includes:
- A **MongoDB mock database** for managing users and postcards.
- A **Node.js + Express API** for CRUD operations and reciprocal postcard sending.
- A **Firefox Extension** for sorting and hybrid searching PostCrossing URLs open in browser tabs.

This project was built for academic purposes to demonstrate API design, database modeling, and browser extension development.

# ⚙️ Features Implemented
## 🔁 Reciprocal Postcard Logic
  ### How It Works
    The reciprocal matching system is the core feature of PostCrossing. Here's the detailed workflow:

  ### Scenario 1: Successful Pairing
    1.User A sends request → System checks PendingSends collection
    2.User B found in queue → System pairs them together
    3.Two postcards created:
      Postcard 1: User A → User B
      Postcard 2: User B → User A
    4.Both users receive addresses and can mail physical postcards
    5.User B removed from queue

  ### Scenario 2: No Match Available
    1.User A sends request → System checks PendingSends collection
    2.No users in queue → Cannot pair
    3.User A added to queue → Waits for next user
    4.Next user will be paired with User A

## 🦊 Firefox Extension
### Overview
  The Firefox Extension adds powerful tab management capabilities specifically for PostCrossing postcard pages.

### Features Implemented
  1. Tab Sorting
    Sort postcard tabs in ascending or descending order
    Sorts by card number (e.g., CL-34269 < CN-4087990 < US-11797804)
    Handles country codes and numbers separately for accurate sorting

  2. Hybrid Search ⭐ (Bonus Feature)
    Combines two criteria:
      URL-based search: Matches postcard code (e.g., CN-4087990)
      Title-based search: Matches words in page title (e.g., “Postcard CN”)

      Two search modes:
        AND Mode: Match both title AND code
        OR Mode: Match either title OR code


# 📦 Installation & Setup
## Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or higher)
MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
Firefox Browser (for extension)
Postman (for API testing)
MongoDB Compass (for database GUI)


### Step 1: Clone Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd postcrossing-mock-project

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install

### Step 3: Setup environment
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGO_DB=postcrossing
PORT=3000


### Step 4: Start the Server
  ### Development mode
    npm start
  ### Or with nodemon (auto-restart)
    npm run dev
  
  ### Once connected, you’ll see:
    ✅ MongoDB connected
    🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000

### Step 5: Testing with Postman
  1. Start the backend server
  2. Open Postman
  3. Use the above endpoints (base URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
  4. Send requests using POST / GET methods
  5. Verify results in MongoDB Compass

## FireFox Extension
### Step 6: Load Firefox Extension
  1. Open Firefox
  2. Navigate to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
  3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
  4. Select manifest.json from extension folder
  5. Extension icon appears in toolbar

# 🧠 Optional Future Improvements

- Add React frontend for visualizing users and postcards.
- Implement WebSocket for real-time card updates.
- Add authentication (JWT / OAuth).
- Store postcard images using Cloudinary or Firebase.
